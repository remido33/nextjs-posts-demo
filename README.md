This repository demonstrates my approach to Frontend development with NextJS.
It features two pages: a home page and a post page. 
Users can view, edit or delete posts. 
Next Api is using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as mock data.

## Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
